		<h4 style="border-style:outset;">This is iREACH, a project dedicated to helping communication between doctors and patients like never before. Through seemless automated tracking of physical activity to improve patient monitoring, doctors can see how active their patients have been. Also through the meal entry feature in the mobile app, doctors can also monitor their patients diets. These two pieces of additional information can help doctors better customize their prescribed treatments to each individual patient</h4>
