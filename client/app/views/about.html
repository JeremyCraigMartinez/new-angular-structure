<h1>About Us</h1>
<hr/>
<p>The wearable sensor project sponsored by Washington State University is actively seeking to improve the health care system by streamlining the clinician patient interaction and increasing the accuracy of acquired health related data. The lead mentor is Dr. Hassan Ghasemzadeh and his PhD student is Ramyar Saeed. Our team will be creating an interface suitable for use by both patients and clinicians. Our software suite will focus on identifying sensor locations in real-time and adapting sensory data interpretation accordingly. </p>
